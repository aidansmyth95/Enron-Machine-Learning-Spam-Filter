    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to create a supervised classification process that effectively classifies emails from the Enron email dataset as spam or non-spam. The full dataset is available at: http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/. The emails have been pre-classified as spam or non-spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a binary classification problem, where emails are asssigned feature vectors depending on the occurences of words, and target variabels {1,0} depending on whether the email is classified as spam or not spam (ham). The objective is to use the examples from training set to design up with a function that can map a feature representation of an email to the correct target variable.\n",

    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage in the pipeline is to spilt the test and training data: 70% for the training data and the remainder for the validation and test sets. Testing is an essential aspect of machine learning as the classifiers are trained to estimate for the unknown test samples. As the data set is large hold out validation is sufficient, and there is no need to consider cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there was no data set split then there would be zero measured error, as overfitting would take place.The classifier would effectively memorize the whole data set. This is of no benefit for developing a supervised learning classifier, there must be an unseen test data set to measure the classifier's accuracy. There is a trade-off to be made when splitting the data set. It is important to keep as much data as possible but still keep enough to have low variance estimate of out-of-sample error (OOS).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal when splitting data is to keep as much data for training but still have enough to have low variance estimate of OOS. The entire data set is shuffled and then split, with 70% of the data allocated to the training set. The resulting data sets are stored in seperate pandas data frames. Statistics are collected and recorded on both sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training data (70%) is split in a 5/2 ratio, with the lower ratio being assigned as a hold out validation data set. Alternatively cross validation may bu used, but for the large data set is computationally expensive. Thus, a hold out validation set is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validtion set is used to estimate OOS error and select hyperparameters. The test set is used at the end on the selected classification model for evaluation purposes.\n"

    "Bag of Words is a method of feature extraction from text data. It is a representation of the presence of known words in a given vocabulary. Feature words are tokenized and represented as vectors of word occurences throughout a string or list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features included in the bag of words models affect the performance of the final classifier. There are many possibilities to reduce the features and dimensionality, providing a better more generalized solution. These methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove stop words\n",
    "- Remove infrequent and highly frequent word occurences\n",
    "- TF-IDF Encoding\n",
    "- N-grams\n",
    "- Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination of some of these feature extraction techniques are chosen that will best optimize the classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop words\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop words are a list of words that are so common that they are usually filtered out preprocessing. Some examples include \"he\", \"she\", \"they\" and \"our\". This decision can greatly affect the classifier training, and is tested with or without stop words. Note that n-grams require stop words to remain in place, so it is not always a given to remove stop words. The count vectorizer stop_words parameter offers three options for stop words:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove a pre-defined list of English stop words ('english').\n",
    "- Remove a user-defined list of stop words.\n",
    "- Remove no stop words ('None'), the default option.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Infrequent and Frequent Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Words that occur infrequently in the data sets are of limited benefit to the classifier, as are words that occur in every nearly every document (similar to stop words). The count vectorizer offers a method to remove infrequenct or highly frequent words. The frequency can be specified as a float (percentage occurence in all documents) or an integer (number of occurences over all documents). It is good practice for min_df to be an integer number, and max_df to be a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how low the max_df frequency is configured, there will always be high frequency words that offer little benefit to the supervised learning classifier. TF-IDF is a method of attributing a high value for a given term if it appears often in a particular document and less frequently everywhere else. This describes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). [3] TF-IDF basically scales down the impact of words that occur very frequently in a given document and are empirically less informative than features that occur in a small fraction of the training set. The formula for TF-IDF encoding is explained in [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "The count vectorizer can be copied and transformed to TF-IDF encoding using the transform(X, copy=True) method in sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### N-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "N-grams take N-word pairs in a Bag of Words representation. The use of phrases rather than indivual words with no context in theory should produce more relevant results. However, the use of N-grams would mean that other techniques such as stop words usage and stemming would no longer be suitable. A decision must be made in the design of the model as to which feature extraction methods are more appropriate. For the large Enron email data set, stop word removal should produce more efficient results compared to the use of N-grams, whcih may be computationally costly.\n",

    "#### CountVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The sklearn.feature_extraction.text is useful for creating a Bag of Words representation of the ham or spam training sets. CountVectorizer converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts, producing a sparse representation of the counts using scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CountVectorizer is transformed into a vocabulary of words using the *fit()* function, followed by the *transform()* function to transform the data set to a document-term matrix based on the known vocaublary. The CountVectorizer object also provides a *fit_transform()* method which combines both methods, which is more commonly used."

      "enron corp . , scrambling to restore confidence in its finances , is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $ and billion and $ and billion , and is likely to close a deal within days , according to officials familiar with the matter .\n",
      "the new credit line is intended to bolster enron ' s financial condition and head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence . the new credit would supplement existing lines , which are largely tapped out after enron last week drew down about $ and billion to increase cash reserves and calm fears in the stock , bond and energy markets .\n",
      "an enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line , but said he couldn ' t supply any further details .\n",
      "houston - based enron is the nation ' s biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . once a favorite of wall street , the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that , despite difficulties , its finances remain sound .\n",
      "confidence in enron ' s financial situation was shaken after enron earlier this month announced a $ and million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ and . and billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then - chief financial officer , andrew fastow .\n",
      "last week , enron replaced mr . fastow and said that the securities and exchange commission was looking into the transactions . the company has consistently said that the transactions were proper and legal .\n",
      "enron ' s stock price fell again friday . as of and p . m . , in composite trading on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down and cents at $ and . and . enron shares have fallen and % in the past two weeks and are down and % from a sept . and , and , high of $ and . and .\n",
      "late last week , enron tapped its existing credit lines , with part of that money being used to redeem nearly $ and billion of its outstanding commercial paper , or short - term corporate ious . ron barone of credit - rating agency standard & poor ' s said he believes that enron was \" getting a bit more resistance \" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due . thus , enron probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstanding , he said .\n",
      "the enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly $ and billion cash on hand would give it more financial flexibility .\n",
      "also last week , credit - rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing enron ' s debt and commercial - paper ratings for a possible downgrade . a lower rating could hamper enron ' s core trading businesses .\n",
      "behind the worries among these agencies , in part , is the loss of investor confidence , which one of the rating companies , fitch , said in a report last week could impair \" enron ' s financial flexibility and access to capital markets , therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business . \"\n",
      "the enron spokesman said yesterday that the company ' s trading partners are doing business with enron on \" essentially the same terms \" as they have in the past . \" there has been no significant change in the credit conditions , \" he said . trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant ' s finances .\n",
      "the banks involved in the current negotiations , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , are asking enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past , one official said .\n",
      "bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that enron can meet its commitments . \" confidence in this company was lost , \" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line . \" but confidence will be restored . \"\n",
      "corporations of enron ' s size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency , they have access to cash . in practice , few companies actually make use of these lines . thus , drawing down credit lines , while providing immediate cash , also illustrates the pressure enron is feeling .\n",

      "a year ago enron was the hottest of the hot . while tech stocks were tanking , enron ' s shares gained and % during and . even die - hard enron skeptics - - of which there are many - - had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company . earnings were up and % , and revenues more than doubled .\n",
      "not bad , considering where the company came from . a decade ago and % of enron ' s revenues came from the staid ( and regulated ) gas - pipeline business . no longer . enron has been selling those assets steadily , partly fuelling revenues , but also expanding into new areas . by and , around and % of its revenues and more than and % of its profits came from trading energy , and buying and selling stakes in energy producers .\n",
      "the stock market applauded the move : at its peak , enron was trading at around and times earnings . that ' s more like cisco ' s once tropospheric valuation than the meager and . and times earnings the market affords enron competitor duke energy .\n",
      "but enron management wanted more . it was , after all , a \" new economy \" web - based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded . according to enron chairman and ceo ken lay , the company deserved to be valued accordingly . at a conference early this year he told investors the company ' s stock should be trading much higher - - say $ and , more than double its price then .\n",
      "then the new economy motor stalled . the company ' s president left under strange circumstances . and rumors swirled about enron ' s machinations in california ' s energy markets . investors pored over enron ' s weakening financial statements . but enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of talmudic scholars to penetrate the company ' s cryptic financials . in effect , enron ' s troubles were hiding in plain sight .\n",
      "it should have been a warning . because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company , or how it was trying to make its numbers . most analysts blithely concede that they really didn ' t know how enron made money - - in good markets or bad .\n",
      "not that enron didn ' t make money , it did - - albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required - - but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off - balance sheet transactions , sometimes from energy - trading revenues . and it was very difficult to understand why or how - - or how likely it was enron could do it again next quarter .\n",
      "enron ' s financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff . deep inside the company filings was mention of ljm cayman , l . p . , a private investment partnership . according to enron ' s march and and - k , a \" senior officer of enron is the managing member \" of ljm . well , that was a puzzler . ljm was helping enron \" manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives , including swaps , puts , and collars . \" it was , in a phrase , enron ' s house hedge fund .\n",
      "there is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market - - it is crucial for a market - maker . but having an enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether , especially when the enron executive was the company ' s cfo , andrew fastow . while he severed his connection with ljm ( and related partnerships ) in july of this year - - and left enron in a whirl of confusion last week - - the damage had been done .\n",
      "as stories in this paper have since made clear , mr . fastow ' s ljm partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict - ridden , board - approved ljm - enron relationship . and recently enron ended the merry affair , taking a billion - dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of ljm ' s wrong - footed hedging . analysts , investors , and the securities & exchange commission were left with many questions , and very few answers .\n",
      "to be fair , i suppose , enron did disclose the ljm arrangement more than a year ago , saying it had erected a chinese wall between fastow / ljm and the company . and in a bull market , no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was - - or questioned the strength of the wall . now it matters , as do other enron - hedged financings , a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in and .\n",
      "we didn ' t do anything wrong is mr . lay ' s refrain in the company ' s current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls . that remains to be seen , but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment , and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency .\n",
      "where has enron ' s board of directors been through all of this ? what kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics , government sorts , and retired executives exercised for enron shareholders ? very little , it seems . it is time enron ' s board did a proper investigation , and then cleaned house - - perhaps neatly finishing with themselves .\n",

      "comment & analysis - enron flickers - once a paragon of the new economy , the us energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free - wheeling management , write simon london and sheila mcnulty .\n",
      "enron has some explaining to do . for the past decade or more , the texas - based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast - growing energy trader . now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind .\n",
      "its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year . the us securities and exchange commission is investigating multi - million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer , which resulted in a $ and . and bn reduction in shareholders ' equity . a hastily - convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these \" related - party transactions \" . the departure of andy fastow , the aforementioned cfo , soon followed .\n",
      "with its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies , enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines . yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity .\n",
      "\" this marks the end of enron ' s walk on the wild side , \" observes curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , the investment bank .\n",
      "on the surface , events at enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions , a complex capital structure and poor investor relations . but the root causes go back further . the entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled enron ' s growth in the and s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis . therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle \" new economy \" magic on to old economy companies .\n",
      "enron ' s transformation began in earnest in and with the arrival of jeffrey skilling , who was hired from mckinsey , the management consulting firm , to develop energy trading .\n",
      "for the previous decade enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating us energy markets under the guidance of kenneth lay , a former deputy under - secretary of energy . mr lay remains chairman . but it was mr skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it .\n",
      "the two sides of the business - trading and generation / supply - have always been strange bedfellows . the former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on wall street than in a utility . mr skilling ' s answer in the early and s was to bring in talent from outside the company . one of his first recruits was mr fastow , an expert in securitisation , the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets .\n",
      "the energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself . a management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice - president , director , manager and associate / analyst - much like a consulting firm . employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked , so long as they delivered results . as one of mr skilling ' s early recruits recalled : \" it was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules . \"\n",
      "the seemingly free - wheeling style was based on a \" loose - tight \" management model expounded by tom peters and bob waterman , the management writers and mckinsey alumni . at enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets .\n",
      "up - and - coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory . louise kitchen , the and - year - old british executive who was the creative force behind enron online , the group ' s internet - based trading platform , changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years .\n",
      "balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk , legal commitments , finance and performance evaluation / remuneration . mr skilling once described the approach in this way : \" as long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens , you can do whatever you want around here . \"\n",
      "this approach did deliver growth and innovation . as well as making markets in its core energy products , enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals . the success of enron online allows the group to describe itself as the world ' s leading e - commerce company .\n",
      "it has also started marketing electricity to us consumers through a joint venture with international business machines and america online , the internet service provider .\n",
      "in february this year mr skilling got his reward : he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in fortune magazine ' s list of the and most powerful us corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as ibm , at & t , bank of america and boeing .\n",
      "in retrospect , however , this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price . first was the personal cost to mr skilling . in august he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job . personal , non - health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation .\n",
      "a second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity . in order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded , enron used a range of off - balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion . ljm , the private equity fund in which mr fastow played a role , is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to enron ' s accounts . other financing vehicles include osprey , marlin , whitewing , atlantic water trust and azurix . \" they went after too many things too quickly , \" says stephen moore of moody ' s investors service , the credit ratings agency .\n",
      "a third cost , associated with the last , was a loss of financial transparency . the group ' s extensive use of swaps , options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed .\n",
      "david fleischer , an analyst at goldman sachs , summed up the views of many investors during last week ' s conference call . he told the group ' s management : \" the company ' s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure . there is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable . \"\n",
      "the fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus . \" the problems , in our view , stem from enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills , \" argues raymond niles , analyst at salomon smith barney . \" power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market , and using a fibre - optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated , or only tangentially related , to their core merchant energy business . \"\n",
      "enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures . this time last year mr skilling was arguing that enron broadband was a business worth $ and bn ( # and bn ) in its own right . this helped push the share price to all - time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise .\n",
      "\" they over - promised on the new business they created , \" says chris bartlett , a professor at harvard business school and long - time watcher of the company . \" enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with enron online and the broadband business . to some extent they are now paying the price . \"\n",
      "will enron weather the storm ? notwithstanding the risk of further out - of - the - blue financial shocks , most analysts believe that it will . the merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable . mr niles at salomon smith barney points out that this side of the group drives more than and per cent of earnings and has shown consistent and - and per cent annual growth over the past three years . assets totalling more than $ and bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted , underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group ' s portfolio of physical energy assets .\n",
      "and yet the doubts remain . it is , ultimately , a question of confidence and credibility . investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former . mr lay and his team will have to tighten up .\n",

      "the company , based in houston , dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets - - for electricity , water and everything else . everyone would win under deregulation , enron said - - especially its shareholders , whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets .\n",
      "' ' we are on the side of angels , ' ' mr . skilling said in march , dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in california ' s energy crisis . ' ' people want to have open , competitive markets . they want fair competition . it ' s the american way . ' '\n",
      "but less than a year later , everybody seems to have lost , especially enron ' s investors . enron ' s stock is plunging , and questions about its finances are mounting .\n",
      "some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens , trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile . in a worst - case outlook , enron could become the and version of long - term capital management , the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of and . enron ' s shares have fallen more than and percent this year , erasing $ and billion in shareholder value .\n",
      "enron closed on friday at $ and . and , down and cents , after hitting a and - week low of $ and . and earlier in the day .\n",
      "the future of electricity deregulation is in doubt , thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in california earlier this year - - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation ' s basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market . enron ' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , mr . skilling quit , forcing kenneth l . lay , his predecessor as chief executive and still enron ' s chairman , to resume day - to - day control of the company .\n",
      "the company declined to make senior executives , including mr . lay , available for comment , and asked that questions be submitted in writing . mr . skilling could not be reached .\n",
      "enron ' s problems boiled over earlier this month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ and . and billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in enron ' s regular financial statements . the securities and exchange commission is looking into the company ' s financial reporting , and some investors question whether enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas .\n",
      "the slump in the company ' s shares accelerated after enron revealed the fall in its shareholders ' equity . on wednesday , the company forced out its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who is at the center of the controversy over enron ' s confusing finances . the company , which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from california ' s energy crisis , today faces a potential cash crunch .\n",
      "the surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors ' smoldering concern about enron ' s opaque financial statements . now , with wall street analysts and bond - rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company ' s profits , enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash .\n",
      "enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash . on thursday , the company drew down a $ and . and billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , which have each extended at least $ and million . but because of enron ' s importance in the natural gas and electricity markets , industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide .\n",
      "the supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed , because enron is mainly a trader , rather than a producer , of energy . but a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices , which have swung wildly in the last year .\n",
      "philip k . verleger jr . , an energy - markets economist , emphasized that he thought enron would survive this crisis . but he said it was not clear what would happen if enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company ' s enrononline internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations .\n",
      "' ' you suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - - are they good ? are the firm ' s hedges good ? what ' s the situation ? ' ' mr . verleger said . ' ' it ' s got everyone scared . ' '\n",
      "in the short run , enron ' s credit rating may be its biggest problem . if the company ' s rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed . but creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable , because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company .\n",
      "a drop in the company ' s credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with enron , hurting the company ' s sales and profits .\n",
      "enron ' s credit rating stands several notches above the critical point . but its bonds , which are publicly traded , have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost and percent , comparable with many junk bonds . two of the three major credit - rating agencies , moody ' s investors service and fitch investors service , have put enron ' s bonds on review for possible downgrades .\n",
      "' ' the issue that ' s in the front of everybody ' s mind right now is credit , ' ' said mark gurley , senior vice president and general manager for trading at aquila inc . , one of the nation ' s largest energy traders . aquila is based in kansas city , mo .\n",
      "for now , aquila and other major energy traders and producers , including reliant energy , the el paso corporation and dynegy , are continuing to do business with enron . and mr . gurley said that enron ' s own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of long - term capital management in and .\n",
      "' ' they haven ' t done anything trading - wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down , ' ' he said .\n",
      "still , some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with enron , especially long - term contracts . they also said risk - management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation .\n",
      "mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said on friday that no energy - trading company had stopped doing business with enron . he declined to say whether any of the company ' s trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms . he said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business .\n",
      "but the crisis that enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront . for years , the details of enron ' s finances have been a mystery even to the wall street analysts whose job it is to follow the company , and to the investors who own its stock and bonds . when enron ' s profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets , shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements .\n",
      "now they do . yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask .\n",
      "to others in the industry , the opaqueness of the company ' s financial statements parallels enron ' s efforts to keep its energy - trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements . though they do not expect enron to crumble like long - term capital management , they say that , like the giant hedge fund , enron uses a lot of debt , regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances .\n",
      "the most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet . with names like marlin and osprey , the partnerships have at least $ and . and billion in bonds outstanding , backed by assets like a stake in azurix , enron ' s water company subsidiary . enron has promised that if the partnerships ' debts exceed the value of their assets , enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference .\n",
      "deals with partnerships formed by mr . fastow , who was chief financial officer when they were organized , led to the $ and . and billion write - off in shareholders ' equity that enron announced last week . the company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships .\n",
      "enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter , after being criticized by shareholders . in the process , it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books , reducing its shareholders ' equity by $ and . and billion . but , because of complex accounting rules , the transaction was not apparent in enron ' s quarterly earnings report .\n",
      "the transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that enron may have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . when enron released third - quarter earnings on oct . and , it reported a loss from $ and billion in write - offs on failed investments . the earnings statement did not mention the additional $ and . and billion equity write - down . but the company said its core business had been solidly profitable , and its shares rose .\n",
      "in a conference call with analysts after the announcement , mr . lay , enron ' s chairman , also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity . the reference was a brief one , however , and some listeners did not catch it . those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what enron had done , and many were confused by the accounting procedure . enron ' s stock began to slide , and investors clamored for more information about the write - off . but so far , the company ' s efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors .\n",
      "mr . lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals , but some on wall street say they have come away with doubts about mr . lay ' s grasp of the situation . they say that the two people at enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - - mr . skilling and mr . fastow - - have both left the company .\n",
      "in an interview in late august , mr . lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving mr . fastow . in response to one question about them , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' '\n",
      "mr . palmer of enron disputed any suggestion that mr . lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue , saying mr . lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the s . e . c . investigation . ' ' there is not a whole lot we can say , or should say , about them , ' ' mr . palmer said . he also said the company expected to generate about $ and billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year .\n",
      "in a conference call on tuesday , analysts pressed mr . lay and other top enron executives to reveal more information about the ljm write - down and its other partnerships . instead , they offered only vague explanations of the deal , leaving wall street worried that more write - offs might be coming .\n",
      "david fleischer , a goldman , sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company , was among those who came away concerned . ' ' if enron is unable to clarify its off - balance - sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position , then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets , ' ' he wrote in a research note after the call .\n",
      "to try to reassure investors , enron said late thursday that enrononline , its internet - based trading exchange , executed more than and , and trades that day , a higher - than - normal volume .\n",
      "' ' we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - - and we ' re working on that , ' ' mr . lay said in a statement . ' ' but in the meantime , the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to enron . ' '\n",
      "but those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for wall street . enron ' s stock tumbled almost and percent friday , to its lowest levels in six years .\n",
      "now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of enron ' s off - balance - sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees .\n",
      "carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , calculates that enron may have close to $ and billion in off - balance - sheet debt . she said that enron had for two years been trying to sell about $ and billion in foreign assets - - including properties in latin america and a power plant in india embroiled in a dispute with the state government - - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of enron ' s problems and the souring economy .\n",
      "' ' as enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs , they may have to write those assets down , ' ' ms . coale said . on wednesday , she downgraded her rating on enron to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' neutral . ' '\n",
      "' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts , ' ' ms . coale said .\n",
      "short - sellers , who attacked enron ' s accounting even before the company disclosed the write - off , say the company ' s problems may run even deeper than analysts fear . enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money - losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business , they say .\n",
      "' ' the company still isn ' t disclosing enough to know whether the core business , the trading business , is profitable , ' ' said mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , which recommended shorting enron ' s stock on may and , when it stood at $ and . and . ' ' the issue remains : why are they doing these transactions ? our theory has been that the core operations aren ' t that profitable . ' '\n",
      "james chanos , a leading short - seller who has bet that enron ' s stock will fall , said , ' ' is enron booking gains when it has real profits , but hiding the losses when deals go against it ? ' ' mr . palmer of enron said the company stood by its reported energy - trading profits .\n",
      "even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of enron ' s positions . enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset , in roughly equivalent amounts , by energy it has agreed to buy .\n",
      "' ' with these guys , they tell us - - and all you ' ve got is their word - - that they ' re hedged , ' ' said mr . verleger , the economist .\n",
      "in fact , enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations . last year , the company successfully lobbied congress to effectively ensure that its internet - trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission .\n",
      "enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the federal energy regulatory commission , the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets . but the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices .\n",
      "large - scale energy trading has existed for only about a half - dozen years . enron pioneered the business , and now dominates it , accounting for about one - quarter of all trading in the united states .\n",
      "before congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity , a process that began in earnest a decade ago , the power business was a simpler affair . utilities were given areas of monopoly service , and their rates - - and ability to deliver enough electricity - - were overseen by state regulators . but with the move to deregulate the business , independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished , providing an ever - growing portion of the nation ' s power .\n",
      "beginning in the and ' s , the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated , spurring enron , which used to be primarily a gas - pipeline company , to move into the trading business .\n",
      "the company ' s shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid - and ' s , with the ascension of mr . skilling , who became chief executive in february , just six months before his unexpected resignation . underscoring the change in direction , in securities filings this year enron described its principal business as ' ' security brokers , dealers and flotation . ' ' before , it had said it was in the business of ' ' wholesale - petroleum and petroleum products . ' '\n",
      "for most of its ascent , enron reported outstanding profit figures and wall street accepted them with pleasure . a year ago , when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by mr . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer , analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of mr . fastow ' s involvement .\n",
      "enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch . but the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short - term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring . the controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - - unless enron loses its investment - grade credit rating before that .\n",
      "enron will also need to maintain its large trading positions , which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about enron ' s credit . when long - term capital was stumbling in and , some wall street rivals sold the securities they thought long - term owned , trying to force long - term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss . something similar in energy markets might be possible . if so , enron might find , as long - term did , that positions that should offset each other do not .\n",
      "enron ' s new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company ' s profits are real , and that its condition is better than the short - sellers believe . as questions are answered , confidence , and the share price , could rebound .\n",
      "but for now , investors are skittish , and some competitors are eager to take advantage of enron ' s plight .\n",

      "at the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the enron corporation are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , beginning in the summer of and . because they were transactions among related parties , the company was required to disclose them , but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered . following are some questions that investors are asking , and the currently available answers .\n",
      "q . why did enron enter into the deals ?\n",
      "a . enron ' s first disclosures , in and , gave no reason . in later reports , it said it was seeking to ' ' hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , ' ' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies .\n",
      "q . how did those investments do ?\n",
      "a . it looks as if they plunged in value , although there is no clear disclosure on that .\n",
      "q . why can ' t that be discerned ?\n",
      "a . the company never said just what the investments were . and the transactions with the partnerships were complicated , involving a variety of derivative securities , enron stock and various promissory notes . enron ' s financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely .\n",
      "q . why were they so complicated ?\n",
      "a . one reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage . one accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock . if a company sells its shares at $ and each and then buys them back - - whether for $ and or $ and - - there is no gain or loss . but shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet - - in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in , or paid out , on the transactions . enron ' s transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule .\n",
      "q . who made money from these transactions ?\n",
      "a . enron reported some profits along the way from the deals , although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings . and it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors .\n",
      "q . if the deals began in and , why all the uproar now ?\n",
      "a . many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well . as long as enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter , they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important .\n",
      "q . when were concerns raised with enron ?\n",
      "a . the complaints grew as enron ' s share price fell earlier this year . by this summer , enron decided that mr . fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships . then , because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to enron , the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions . but investors were still worried , and enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships .\n",
      "q . how did enron do ?\n",
      "a . badly . it took a $ and million loss , which , given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken , was not very much . but it also reduced shareholder equity by $ and . and billion .\n",
      "q . how did that happen ?\n",
      "a . that , like so much else , is not clear . but it looks as if the partnership owed enron that much money , could not pay and was let off the hook by enron . in return , enron terminated ' ' previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver enron shares in future periods . ' ' enron treated that like a share buyback , even though the shares in question had not been issued , and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings .\n",
      "q . is that legal under the accounting rules ?\n",
      "a . presumably it is . but enron ' s limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure . enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements , while leaving profits on them . that may become clearer when the securities and exchange commission , which has begun preliminary inquiries , completes its work . floyd norris\n",

      "welcome back to sept . and .\n",
      "the ' ' america strikes back ' ' optimism that surged after sept . and has now been stricken by the multitude of ways we ' re losing the war at home . the f . b . i . has proved more effective in waging turf battles against rudy giuliani than waging war on terrorism . of the more than and suspects arrested , exactly zero have been criminally charged in the world trade center attack ( though one has died of natural causes , we ' re told , in a new jersey jail cell ) . the bush team didn ' t fully recognize that a second attack on america had begun until more than a week after the first casualty . the most highly trumpeted breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists - - tom ridge ' s announcement that ' ' the site where the letters were mailed ' ' had been found in new jersey - - proved a dead end . and now the president is posing with elementary - school children again .\n",
      "given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with c . e . o . clockwork , perhaps it should be added to the growing list of things that have changed forever since sept . and . but let ' s not be so hasty . not everything changes that fast - - least of all washington . the white house ' s home - front failures are not sudden , unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since jan . and .\n",
      "this is an administration that will let its special interests - - particularly its high - rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right - - have veto power over public safety , public health and economic prudence in war , it turns out , no less than in peacetime . when anthrax struck , the administration ' s first impulse was not to secure as much cipro as speedily as possible to protect americans , but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer . the white house ' s faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week ' s house ' ' stimulus ' ' package showering $ and million on enron , the reeling houston energy company ( now under s . e . c . investigation ) that has served as a bush campaign cash machine .\n",
      "airport security , which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since sept . and , is also held hostage by campaign cash : as salon has reported , servicemaster , a supplier of the low - wage employees who ineptly man the gates , is another g . o . p . donor . not that republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first . in a display of bipartisanship , democrats - - lobbied by linda hall daschle , the senate majority leader ' s wife - - joined the administration in handing the airlines a $ and billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry ' s c . e . o . ' s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees .\n",
      "to see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security , you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation - - and one that explains the recent trials of poor tom ridge .\n",
      "mr . ridge is by all accounts a capable leader - - a successful governor of a large state ( pennsylvania ) who won the bronze star for heroism in vietnam . a close friend of george w . bush , he should have been in the administration from the get - go , and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs , including the vice presidency . but after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights , he got zilch . instead of mr . ridge , the administration signed on the pro - life john ashcroft and tommy thompson - - who have brought us where we are today .\n",
      "the farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations - - though mr . thompson often comes across as a chamber of commerce glad - hander who doesn ' t know his pants are on fire , and mr . ashcroft often shakes as if he ' s not just seen great caesar ' s ghost but perhaps john mitchell ' s as well . both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration . they ' ve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their no . and concern .\n",
      "pre - sept . and , mr . thompson , in defiance of science , heartily lent his credibility to the bush administration ' s stem cell ' ' compromise ' ' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers . post - sept . and , he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat , also in defiance of science . now he maintains that the $ and . and billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system - - almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals , not shoring up local hospitals - - is adequate for fighting bioterrorism . this , too , is in defiance of all expert estimates , including that of the one physician in the senate , the republican bill frist .\n",
      "it should also be on mr . thompson ' s conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government ' s house physician - - david satcher , the surgeon general and a much - needed honest broker of public health - - locked away , presumably because dr . satcher , a clinton appointee , became persona non grata in the bush administration for issuing a june report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right . only after mr . ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag .\n",
      "as for mr . ashcroft , he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons . planned parenthood , which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them , has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one . this was true not only before sept . and but , says ann glazier , planned parenthood ' s director of security , remains true - - even though her organization , long targeted by such home - grown talibans as the army of god , has a decade ' s worth of leads on ' ' the convergence of international and domestic terrorism . ' '\n",
      "ms . glazier found the sight of mr . ashcroft and other federal keystone kops offering a $ and million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy . ' ' religious extremists don ' t respond to money , ' ' she points out . such is the state of the f . b . i . , she adds , that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ' ' because we have so many here we ' re afraid we ' re going to lose it ' ' ( perhaps among the timothy mcveigh documents ) .\n",
      "if either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that , say , mayor giuliani does , there wouldn ' t have been a need to draft mr . ridge . even so , he ' s mainly a p . r . gimmick - - a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights . as director of homeland security , he ' s allegedly charged with supervising nearly and government agencies - - so far with roughly a dozen staff members . when asked to define mr . ridge ' s responsibilities , ari fleischer said on wednesday that it was ' ' a very busy coordination job , ' ' but so far mr . ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion .\n",
      "the one specific duty that he has claimed - - in an interview with tom brokaw - - was that he ' d be the one ' ' making the phone call ' ' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers . that presumably comes as news to donald rumsfeld , who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the air force chain of command he publicly codified days after mr . ridge ' s appointment .\n",
      "since the administration tightly metes out the news from afghanistan , we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here - - even as mr . rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the taliban , once expected to implode in days , are proving viet - cong - like in their intractability . the wall street journal also reported this week that ' ' instead of a thankful afghan population , popular support for the taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the u . s . growing . ' '\n",
      "maybe we ' re losing that battle for afghan hearts and minds in part because the bush state department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a c . e . o . ( from madison avenue ) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like head & shoulders shampoo . if we can ' t effectively fight anthrax , i guess it ' s reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff .\n",

    "\n",
    "The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification). The distribution requires integer counts or TF-IDF fractional counts. It is a simple classifier to start with, a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorum with strong and naive assumptions. Despite its simplistic approach, Naive Bayes performs well in complex text-based classification applications, and is known as a competent email classifier [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is less computationally expensive in both CPU and memory compared to other models that might outperform it. Multinomial Naive Bayes is often implemented when the frequency of the words are inportant in the classification problem [6].\n",
    "\n",
    " We estimate the conditional probability of a term belongingto a class as the relative frequency of the term in documents belonging to class. [7][5]\n",
    " \n",
    "Naive Bayesian classifiers make assumptions about data, and will generally not perform as well as a more complicated classification model. However, they have several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are extremely fast for training and prediction\n",
    "- They provide probabilistic prediction\n",
    "- They have very few possible tunable hyparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "These advantages make ita good choice as an initial classifier choice. Naive Bayes classifiers perform well in the following circumstances:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the naive assumptions match the data\n",
    "- When model complexity is less important for well seperated data\n",
    "- For high-dimensional data\n",
    "\n",

The main idea is that instead of computing the gradient of the loss for the full dataset, estimate it using a randomly chosen example and move in that direction.

Given that the data is sparse, it can scale to handle problems with over 10^5 features relatively easily [14].\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The training set is encoded as a Bag of Words representation, and transformed to TF-IDF format. Several classifiers are trained on the training set. Tuning and model selection takes place on the validation set, proir to final model evaluation on the unseen test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuned Linear SVC classification performs best with the given spam detection application and data sets. All three supervised classifiers perform to a high degree of accuracy (98% to 99%). A main contributing factor to this high accuracy is the feature extraction and pre-processing decisions, such as the use of stop-word removal, ignoring numbers and using TF-IDF encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model could be improved using a larger data set, better ham or spam examples, stemming, more complicated and computationally expensive algorithms, or by performing more exhaustive hyperparameter tuning on more cross-validation iterations. A dedicate GPU could be appropriate to perform  the extensive cross-validation timing required to tune moore complex modelsto a higher degree of accuracy. This project combines an effective solution that is relatively computationally cheap to design."
